## Turrets

### Duo (v153)

_**Overview**_  [🔗](https://mindustrygame.github.io/wiki/blocks/348-duo/)  
_"Fires alternating bullets at enemies."_  
Duo is the first turret utilized that only costs copper. Has 3 ammo types: Copper, Graphite, and Silicon.

_Camapign_  
It generally faces off against T1 (such as Dagger or Crawler).  

Problem Set
1. Graphite is better than Silicon in most ways.
2. Boost amount is nicheless (unsuable).
